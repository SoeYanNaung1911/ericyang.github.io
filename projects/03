# Data Cleansing in Grocery Store Sales  

## Project Overview  
In this project, I focus on **cleaning and preparing grocery sales data** to ensure accuracy and reliability. Clean data is essential for making informed business decisions, and this process helps eliminate inconsistencies, duplicates, and errors.  

## About the Business

**FoodYum** is a grocery store chain operating across the United States, offering a variety of products, including **produce, meat, dairy, baked goods, and household essentials**.  

With rising food costs, FoodYum wants to ensure that their inventory remains diverse and affordable for all customers. To achieve this, they need **clean and structured data** that accurately reflects their product offerings and customer purchases.  

## The Dataset  
The dataset comes from the `products` table and contains **customer purchase records from the past year**.  

### Key Data Cleaning Tasks:  
‚úî Handling missing values  
‚úî Removing duplicates  
‚úî Standardizing category names  
‚úî Fixing incorrect pricing data  
‚úî Ensuring data consistency for analysis  

## Why Data Cleansing Matters  
Unclean data can lead to **misleading insights and poor decision-making**. By thoroughly cleaning this dataset, we ensure that FoodYum can make accurate **inventory and pricing decisions** based on trustworthy data.
